# Time Series Decomposition App with PyQt5 and Matplotlib

This project presents a simple application based on PyQt5 for visualizing the temporal decomposition of a time series using the `statsmodels` library in Python and integrating Matplotlib for interactive display.

## Features

- Select a column from a DataFrame using a graphical interface.
- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- Display the results in a user-friendly interface with the ability to explore different components.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-user/TimeSeriesDecompositionApp.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Configuration

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
