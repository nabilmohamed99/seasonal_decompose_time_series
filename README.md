# Time Series Decomposition App with PyQt5 and Matplotlib

This project presents a simple application based on PyQt5 for visualizing the temporal decomposition of a time series using the `statsmodels` library in Python and integrating Matplotlib for interactive display.

## Features

- Select a column from a DataFrame using a graphical interface.
- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- Display the results in a user-friendly interface with the ability to explore different components.
